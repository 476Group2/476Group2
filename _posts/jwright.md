## ABOUT ME

My current goals are to learn as much as I can at my present job. I hope to use my skills and experience from my job at the Texas A&M Foundation to allow me to excel at my next job. 
I am interested in a career in cybersecurity as it is an exciting field with a great outlook. I partake in a wide variety of hobbies as well. 
I am an avid shooter and go to the gun range as often as I can. I also reload ammunition which I find fun and relaxing, and it also allows for less expensive ammo. In addition to these I enjoy playing racquetball.

## Todays Post

- CZ75 BD 
- Glenfield 30A
- M1 Garand
