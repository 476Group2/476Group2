##ABOUT ME

HOWDY!

Thank you for taking the time to stop by and visit my webpage. My name is Clarissa Huerta, most people call me Claire. I created this webpage to showcase some of the skills that I have acquired through courses that I have taken while attending Texas A&M University. To find out more about the greatest university in the world visit the official website of Texas A&M University. I've always had a love for both technology and business, from the biggest to the smallest things that they both have to offer. For that same reason I decided to major in Technology Management and minor in Business Administration. You can learn more about what Technology Management has to offer and the classes that are required for this major by visiting the Technology Management website. I hope you enjoy learning more about me and what I have to offer as you navigate throughout the webpage.

Thanks and Gig'em!
